# Image Based Identification of Machine Parts
We've harnessed the power of advanced machine learning technologies to develop an image-based identification system that excels at distinguishing machine parts from other objects. Our tech stack, including Python, NumPy, matplotlib, and pandas, empowers the system with the tools it needs to analyze images effectively and make precise determinations about whether they depict specific machine parts. This, in turn, provides us with reliable and highly efficient identification capabilities.

In this project, we leverage Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and heatmap techniques to provide visual explanations for our machine learning model's predictions. Grad-CAM helps us understand the model's decision-making process by highlighting the regions in the uploaded image that significantly influence the prediction. This allows users to gain insights into the specific features and patterns the model is using to identify the machine part.

The heatmap generated by Grad-CAM visually indicates the areas of the image that contribute the most to the final prediction. By overlaying the heatmap on the original image, users can quickly grasp which regions the model focused on to arrive at its conclusion, enhancing transparency and interpretability. This not only builds trust in the system's predictions but also facilitates potential improvements in the model and dataset based on the insights gained from the visual explanations.

We have deployed an our ML model for predicting machine parts via our user-friendly website. We can get accurate results by simply uploading an image. 

# Our Tech Stack
We have seamlessly integrated a powerful tech stack featuring prominent libraries like NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib. In addition, we harnessed the exceptional capabilities of machine learning by employing state-of-the-art frameworks like Keras and TensorFlow. We have utilized Flask to seamlessly deploy our machine learning model on a website, offering an effortless user experience for predicting machine parts.
