# Image Based Identification of Machine Parts
We've harnessed the power of advanced machine learning technologies to develop an image-based identification system that excels at distinguishing machine parts from other objects. Our tech stack, including Python, NumPy, matplotlib, and pandas, empowers the system with the tools it needs to analyze images effectively and make precise determinations about whether they depict specific machine parts. This, in turn, provides us with reliable and highly efficient identification capabilities.

In this project, we leverage Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and heatmap techniques to provide visual explanations for our machine learning model's predictions. Grad-CAM helps us understand the model's decision-making process by highlighting the regions in the uploaded image that significantly influence the prediction. This allows users to gain insights into the specific features and patterns the model is using to identify the machine part.

The heatmap generated by Grad-CAM visually indicates the areas of the image that contribute the most to the final prediction. By overlaying the heatmap on the original image, users can quickly grasp which regions the model focused on to arrive at its conclusion, enhancing transparency and interpretability. This not only builds trust in the system's predictions but also facilitates potential improvements in the model and dataset based on the insights gained from the visual explanations.

# Our Tech Stack
We have seamlessly integrated a powerful tech stack featuring prominent libraries like NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib. In addition, we harnessed the exceptional capabilities of machine learning by employing state-of-the-art frameworks like Keras and TensorFlow. This amalgamation of sophisticated tools and frameworks allows our system to achieve unrivaled proficiency in distinguishing machine parts from other objects with remarkable accuracy and efficiency.

# Data set 
Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmaneunus/mechanical-tools-dataset

As an added measure to enhance the accuracy of our trained model, we've gone the extra mile by incorporating an additional dataset comprising random pictures with almost 18k diverse and varied images.

Our machine learning model is seamlessly deployed using the widely-adopted JSON format, facilitating effortless saving and loading on local devices for enhanced user convenience.

# In process
We are currently in the process of deploying our project via a user-friendly website, powered by Flask, enabling users to upload images and receive accurate machine part predictions effortlessly.
