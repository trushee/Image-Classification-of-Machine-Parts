# Image Based Identification of Machine Parts
We've harnessed the power of advanced machine learning technologies to develop an image-based identification system that excels at distinguishing machine parts from other objects. Our tech stack, including Python, NumPy, matplotlib, and pandas, empowers the system with the tools it needs to analyze images effectively and make precise determinations about whether they depict specific machine parts. This, in turn, provides us with reliable and highly efficient identification capabilities.

# Our Tech Stack
We have seamlessly integrated a powerful tech stack featuring prominent libraries like NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib. In addition, we harnessed the exceptional capabilities of machine learning by employing state-of-the-art frameworks like Keras and TensorFlow. This amalgamation of sophisticated tools and frameworks allows our system to achieve unrivaled proficiency in distinguishing machine parts from other objects with remarkable accuracy and efficiency.

# Data set 
Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmaneunus/mechanical-tools-dataset

As an added measure to enhance the accuracy of our trained model, we've gone the extra mile by incorporating an additional dataset comprising random pictures with almost 18k diverse and varied images.
